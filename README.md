Part of the Odin Project Foundation Course.
Very close to completing this and moving on to JS, node, and React.
This will give me the skill and practice of manipulating the DOM tree.

There are a ton of things that I would like to add but it has all of the necessary features. There's more work to be done in the design of the webpage and the shading functions along with adding more features that I have seen from other projects. 
Learned a lot and would like to revisit this project at a later time.
